# Docket Technical Interview

Hi Nic,

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

The code snippet and expected entry point to the technical interview is in `src/app/page.tsx`.

Tests are located in `__tests__/page.test.tsx`.

I wrote this code snippet with these specific intentions in mind:
- A simple starting point that can be expanded to consider componentization, backend API creation, CRUD functionality, etc.
- Use placeholder JSON data, and move away from that placeholder data to use actual connections to persistent data stores
- Use the Next.js framework features to abstract away incidental complexity

Included are the Jest testing library, and the @testing-library family of testing functionality. This could be expanded to include end-to-end testing tools such as Playwright.

Best,

Alex
